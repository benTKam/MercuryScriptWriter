Automate Crestron Mercury Configuration


## Description

I wrote this program to automate some of the work when setting up multiple Crestron Mercury devices. 
The program takes data from a spreadhsheet we get from a client with configuration information and puts it into the excel sheets
used by Crestrons enterprise setup utility. The program can then run the individual Powershell executables to send the configuration to the 
devices on the network. Additionally, the program can open chrome tabs and automatically logins into all the devices for
further configuration.
